Steps to install:
=================

To compile the gkfreq_cpuX.so files:
    make

Then install in either /usr/lib/gkrellm2/plugins/ by doing
    make install
or in /usr/local/lib/gkrellm2/plugins/ by doing
    make install-local
or in ~/.gkrellm2/plugins by doing
    make install-home

Now the plugin is installed. Start GKrellM and enable gkfreq_cpuX (one per 
CPU).
